# Local Notes

This file is for specifics unique to your setup — things the agent should know about your environment.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Project conventions and coding standards
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Service URLs and ports
- Device or environment nicknames
- Anything environment-specific that helps the agent do its job

## Why Separate?

The soul and agent guidelines are shared defaults. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update defaults without losing your notes, and customize behavior without forking the whole prompt.
